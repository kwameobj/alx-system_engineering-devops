## Steps Taken To Complete Project 
- Firstly, I entered my sandbox through the webterm and cloned the repository for my assignment and created the necessary directories and added my intial README file

- I then proceeded to complete the tasks and store my screenshots locally at:
/home/kowusubamfo/command_line_for_the_win

- Whilst in the same directory as my screenshot files, I established a STFP connection to the sandbox environment and used the `put` command to upload my screenshots.

	### How I Used STFP Command-line Tool
	* I copied the STFP command from sandbox of preference from my ALX dashboard sandboxes tab; pasted and run it on my local terminal and confirmed addition of the remote server by typing `yes`
	* The password was requested, which was also available for at the sandbox tab, which I copied and pasted; after which the STFP connection was established.
	* I navigated to the directory I was am to upload my screenshots and used the `put` command to upload the screenshots from my local directory to the sandbox environment.
  
- I then exited my STFP connection and entered my sandbox to confirm the successful upload and push the screenshots to GitHub.

- Lastly, I updated my README file with information on the files present and the steps taken to upload the screenshots.
